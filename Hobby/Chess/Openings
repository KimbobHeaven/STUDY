1. e4 (King's pawn opening)
  
  ==========
  
  1...e6 - French Defense (2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 ...)
  
    The French Defense meets 1.e4 with 1...e6, preparing to counter the e4 pawn with 2...d5. 
    Black blocks in their light-squared bishop, but gains a solid pawn chain and counter-attacking possibilities.
  
  Pros:
    Sound structure
    Sharp counterattacking possibilities
    Original type of game
  Cons:
    Black has a space disadvantage
    Light-squared bishop is locked in
    Can become passive
  
  ----------
  
  1...c6 - Caro-Kann Defense (2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 ...)
  
    Black supports the move ...d5, to challenge the e4 pawn, while being ready to recapture. 
    The Caro-Kann is considered to be a fairly solid, quiet opening.
    
  Pros:
    Sound pawn structure
    Free light-squared bishop
    Safe
  Cons:
    Less space for black
    Slower development
    Less complicated game
    
  ----------
  
  1...d5 - Scandinavian Defense (2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qa5 ...)
  
    In the Scandinavian Defense, Black meets 1.e4 by immediately putting the question to the e4 pawn, 
    attacking it with 1...d5. This opening often leads to tricky, scrappy play by Black.
    
  Pros:
    A provocative opening
    Black opens the game immediately
    Usually both black bishops have freedom
  Cons:
    After the capture 2.exd5, Black loses time recapturing
    Usually the white d-pawn will go to d4 afterwards, giving more central space
    Because Black loses some time, he is in danger of a quick knockout
  
  ----------
  
  1...d6 - Pirc Defense (2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 ...)
  
    The Pirc (prounounced 'Peerts') is a newer, radical kind of opening, 
    in which Black allows White to occupy the center with pawns, 
    and then attempts to counterattack the pawn center and prove it to be over-extended. 
    The Pirc Defense always involves the fianchetto of the black king's bishop; 
    if the move ...g6 is not played soon, then it is not the Pirc.
  
  Pros:
    Black has a lot of freedom of different ways to play
    A tricky, active defense
    White can be provoked easily
  Cons:
    White has several systems which lead to a raging attack
    White can also play carefully to restrict Black
    White has many different ways to combat the Pirc
  
  ----------
  
  1...Nf6 - Alekhine's Defense (2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 ...)
  
    A radical defense. Black immediately attacks the e4 pawn with his knight, 
    tempting White to advance all of his center pawns in the hope that they will prove over-extended.
    
  Pros:
    Original
    Tricky
    Less common, so opponents won't know as much
  Cons:
    White gains central space
    Black has to move the knight several times
    Risky 
    
  ----------
  
  1...c5 - Sicilian Defense (2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 ...)
  
    The Sicilian is one of the major answers to 1.e4. 
    Black takes control of the d4 square with a pawn from the side 
    thus he imbalances the position and avoids giving White a central target.

  Pros:
    Unbalances the game
    Gives Black good chances of attack
    Great opening when you need to play for a win
  Cons:
    White has many ways to meet the Sicilian
    In the main variations White gets great attacking chances
    There is a lot of theory
  
  ----------
  
  1...c5 2. Nc3 - Sicilian Defense : Closed (2...Nc6 3. Nf3 e6 ...)
  
    The 2.Nc3 of the Closed Sicilian introduces a slower way of building up. 
    Rather than breaking Black's grip on d4 with a quick d2-d4, White plays 2.Nc3 
    followed by fianchettoing the king bishop, sometimes with a slow attack on the kingside in mind.
    
  Pros:
    Avoids the heavy theory of the Open Sicilian
    Leads to a slower, strategic type of play, undesirable for many Sicilian players
  Cons:
    Allows Black to develop his pieces comfortably
    Gives Black a good plan of attack with ...b5
    Leaves Black with good control of the d4 square
  
  ----------
  
  1...c5 2. c3 - Sicilian Defense : Alapin Variation (2...Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 ...)
  
    White does not have to combat the Sicilian by playing with 2.Nf3 and 3.d4; 
    one way to avoid the main lines is to prepare d2-d4 by playing 2.c3, 
    planning to recapture with the pawn. This leads to completely different kinds of positions, and is known as the Alapin.
    
  Pros:
    White avoids trading a central pawn for a wing pawn
    Leads to open, active play
    Tricky
  Cons:
    Blocks the c3 square for the Nb1
    Does not develop a piece
    Allows Black a large choice of ways to respond
  
  ----------
  
  1...e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 - Ruy LÃ³pez Opening (3...a6 ...)
  
    Also called the "Spanish Game". White's 3.Bb5 move puts pressure on the knight 
    which is guarding the center, while developing rapidly.
    
  Pros:
    Leads to very complex and multifaceted play
    Tends to give White long-term pressure
    White develops rapidly and castles quickly
  Cons:
    Some lines are very theoretical
    Black has a huge number of defenses to choose from
    Sometimes Black gets a chance to later attack the light-squared bishop
    
  ----------
    
  1...e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 - Italian Game (3...Bc5 ...)
    
    In the Italian game White develops the bishop to a strong diagonal, 
    aiming through the center at f7. Depending on how the players continue, 
    it may turn into open, gambit play; or slower, maneuvering play.
      
  Pros:
    Natural play
    Focus on the center
    Rapid development
  Cons:
    The bishop on c4 might be exposed
    Black's center is not under immediate pressure
    
  ----------
  
  1...e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 - Scotch Game (3...exd4 ...)
  
    Rather than develop another piece, in the Scotch Game White chooses to break open the center, challenging the e5 pawn.
    
  Pros:
    White virtually guarantees himself a space advantage
    Black is unable to maintain the e5 point
    Avoids the well-analyzed Ruy Lopez
  Cons:
    Releases the tension very early
    Recapturing the d4 pawn will require a second move by the white knight
    The e4 pawn can later come under attack
    
  ----------
  
  1...e5 2. Nc3 - Vienna Game (2...Nf6 3.Nf3 Nc6 ...)
  
    In the Vienna Game, rather than the more common 2.Nf3 - attacking the black e-pawn 
    White chooses to instead concentrate on defense of his own pawn. 
    The could be a prelude to either an aggressive strike with f2-f4, or slower build-ups involving Bc4 or g3 and Bg2.
    
  Pros:
    Less theoretical than the Spanish Game
    Avoid Petrov's Defense
    White has strategically clear formations
  Cons:
    Puts less immediate pressure on Black
    Blocking the c-pawn makes preparing d2-d4 more difficult
    
  ----------
  
  1...e5 2. f4 - King's Gambit (2...exf4 3. Nf3 g5 ...)
  
    White sacrifices the f-pawn to knock out Black's central e5 pawn. 
    Ideally White would like to take over the center and regain the pawn on f4.
    
  Pros:
    Very exciting opening
    White goes for the initiative
    Unusual positional themes
  Cons:
    Black has many different options to choose from
    Black can decline the gambit in a number of ways
    White's king can become exposed
